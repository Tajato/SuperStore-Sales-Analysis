## Super Store Sales Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a dataset from Tableau of a retail company. My main goal was to extract some quick insights regarding the company's sales from the dataset using Excel. 
I utilized Excel's PivotTable and several functions such as CountIF throughout my analysis. Finally, I created a dashboard in Excel to showcase visualizations of the key insights.

I created a final Power Point presentation. I ask you to open that file and read through the presentation to see how I explored this data and the recommendations I made. You can either open the Power Point presentation or the PDF version of the presentation. Thank you!
